abstract: Peru is the second largest host nation of Venezuelan migrants. This
  paper combines newly available data on Venezuelans residing in Peru and the
  Peruvian Household Survey to assess the impact of migration on natives’ labor
  market outcomes. We first rely upon education-experience groups to define
  labor markets and find that immigration does not affect the wages of competing
  native workers. We then slice the labor market into occupations based on the
  observation that in Peru, immigrants and natives with similar education and
  experience are likely to work in different occupations. Our instrumental
  variable estimates confirm the null effect on wages. We finally examine
  whether natives respond with changes in employment and find that 10 Venezuelan
  workers create informal employment for 38 Peruvians and displace 13 Peruvians
  from formal jobs, suggesting a change in the Peruvian employment composition
  toward informality.
